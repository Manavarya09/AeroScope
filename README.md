AeroScope follows a **black-and-white minimal design language**:
- Typography-focused (Inter / Space Grotesk)
- No icons or colors ‚Äî clarity through layout and contrast
- Generous spacing, grid-aligned elements
- Subtle shadows, glass effects, and slow transitions
- Zero clutter, zero distractions

Every element has a purpose ‚Äî to guide the user‚Äôs focus and highlight data precision.
